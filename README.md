# Various-Recommender-Systems-projects

A recommender system, or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as platform or engine), is a subclass of information filtering system that provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user. Typically, the suggestions refer to various decision-making processes, such as what product to purchase, what music to listen to, or what online news to read.[1] Recommender systems are particularly useful when an individual needs to choose an item from a potentially overwhelming number of items that a service may offer.
